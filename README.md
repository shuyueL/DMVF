This paper presents a consensus-based distributed multi-agent video fast-forwarding framework, named DMVF, that fast-forwards multi-view video streams collaboratively and adaptively. 

In our framework, each camera view is addressed by a reinforcement learning based fast-forwarding agent, which periodically chooses from multiple strategies to selectively process video frames and transmitting the selected frames at adjustable paces.

During every adaptation period, each agent communicates with a number of neighboring agents, evaluates the importance of the selected frames from itself and those from its neighbors by comparing their similarities, and refines such evaluation together with other agents via a system-wide consensus algorithm. Eventually all agents in the system reach a consensus on the importance of their selected frames in the current adaptation period and use it to decide their strategy for the next period.

The above gif is a short fast-forwarded example generated by DMVF. The first row is the original videos of the six views and the second row is the fast-forwarded result. The black screens represent those frames we skipped. The full video examples can be found in **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/124RW1_aLwkvSIyYHvtFAFY20eSrBT-Ih?usp=sharing)**.
